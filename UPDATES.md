1.1 - 2019-02-15
------------------
* Several UI adjustments
* Dark mode setting is persistent between sessions, via a cookie
* Hence, the GDPR cookie banner... (which we should have had anyway for session cookies, evidently)
* There is now a tool that shows your client IP address in the lookup field, under the top-right settings menu
* We added keyboard shortcuts for tools, focusing on the domain/IP field, increasing/decreasing text size, and for copying the current lookup URL
* Speaking of lookup URLs, we now have lookup URLs! The browser address changes as you access different tools, and there's a convenient copy link button to the right of the lookup field - great for sharing lookups for troubleshooting
